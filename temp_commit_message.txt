feat: Implement Phase 1, 2, and 3 of Cognitive Enhancement Plan

This commit integrates enhanced cognitive dimensions into the memory representation,
refines the activation engine, and exposes bridge discovery as a first-class API feature.

Key changes include:
- Augmenting Memory entity to persist full cognitive dimensions in `src/storage/sqlite/repositories/memory_repository.py`.
- Integrating full dimensions into vector composition in `src/embedding/vector_manager.py`.
- Updating the ingestion pipeline to use full dimensions in `src/pipeline/ingestion_pipeline.py`.
- Leveraging dimensions in the semantic search API in `src/api/routers/memories.py`.
- Exposing activation parameters in the cognitive query API in `src/api/routers/cognitive.py`.
- Refining starting memories with cognitive dimensions in `src/cognitive/activation/basic_activation_engine.py`.
- Creating a dedicated bridge discovery API router in `src/api/routers/bridges.py`.
- Integrating the bridge discovery router into the main API in `src/api/main.py`.
- Updating `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` to reflect completed phases.
