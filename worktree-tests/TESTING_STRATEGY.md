## 📋 DETAILED TEST SPECIFICATIONS

### Critical Business Logic Tests

#### Activation Spreading Algorithm
**Goal**: Validate the core cognitive algorithm that makes this system unique

```python
def test_activation_spreading_with_real_data(self):
    """Test activation spreading with real memory network"""
    # Setup: Create 100 interconnected memories
    memories = create_test_memory_network(size=100)
    
    # Test: Query for "caching strategy"  
    query_vector = encode_real_text("What was decided about caching?")
    results = activation_engine.spread_activation(query_vector)
    
    # Validation:
    assert len(results) > 0
    assert results[0].score > 0.7  # High relevance
    assert all(r.activation_path for r in results)  # Has activation paths
    assert results[0].memory.content contains "caching"  # Semantically relevant
```

#### Memory Quality Validation
**Goal**: Ensure extracted memories are semantically accurate and useful

```python
def test_memory_extraction_quality(self):
    """Test extracted memories are semantically accurate"""
    transcript = """
    Alice: We decided to implement Redis for caching.
    Bob: That's a great decision. I'll handle the implementation.
    Charlie: When do we need this completed?
    Bob: By Friday end of day.
    """
    
    memories = memory_extractor.extract(transcript)
    
    # Validate memory types
    decision_memories = [m for m in memories if m.content_type == ContentType.DECISION]
    action_memories = [m for m in memories if m.content_type == ContentType.ACTION]

    assert "Redis" in decision_memories[0].content
    assert "caching" in decision_memories[0].content
    
    assert len(action_memories) >= 1  
    assert "implementation" in action_memories[0].content
    assert action_memories[0].owner == "Bob"
```

#### Vector Similarity Accuracy
**Goal**: Ensure vector calculations produce semantically meaningful results

```python
def test_semantic_similarity_accuracy(self):
    """Test vector similarity captures semantic meaning"""
    test_pairs = [
        # High similarity pairs
        ("implement caching", "add cache layer", 0.8),
        ("Redis database", "Redis cache", 0.9),
        # Low similarity pairs  
        ("caching strategy", "meeting agenda", 0.3),
        ("Redis implementation", "coffee break", 0.1)
    ]
    
    for text1, text2, expected_min_similarity in test_pairs:
        vec1 = encoder.encode(text1)
        vec2 = encoder.encode(text2)
        similarity = cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2)
        
        assert similarity >= expected_min_similarity
```

### Performance Validation Tests

#### Real-World Performance Targets
**Goal**: Validate system meets stated performance requirements

    times = []
    for text in texts:
        start = time.perf_counter()
        embedding = encoder.encode(text)
        elapsed_ms = (time.perf_counter() - start) * 1000
        times.append(elapsed_ms)
    
    # Statistical analysis
    mean_time = statistics.mean(times)
    percentile_95 = statistics.quantiles(times, n=20)[19]  # 95th percentile
    
    assert mean_time < 50  # Average under 50ms
    assert percentile_95 < 100  # 95% under 100ms
    
def test_full_query_performance_with_10k_memories(self):
    """Test query performance with realistic data size"""
    # Setup: 10,000 real memories
    setup_large_memory_database(size=10000)
    
    query = "What decisions were made about the new feature?"
    
    start = time.perf_counter()
    results = cognitive_query_engine.query(query)
    elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start
    
    assert elapsed < 2.0  # Under 2 seconds

    assert results[0].score > 0.5  # Quality results
```

### Integration & Error Handling Tests

    memories = create_test_memories(count=10)
    for memory in memories:
        system.store_memory(memory)
    
    # Simulate Qdrant failure
    with mock_qdrant_failure():
        # Should still work with reduced functionality
        query_results = system.query("test query")
        
        # Should return some results (from SQLite metadata)
        assert len(query_results) > 0
        # Should indicate degraded mode
        assert system.get_health_status().vector_store_status == "degraded"

def test_concurrent_operations_no_deadlock(self):
    """Test concurrent operations don't cause deadlocks"""
    import threading
    
    def concurrent_ingest():
        transcript = f"Meeting {threading.current_thread().ident}"
        system.ingest_meeting(transcript)
    
    def concurrent_query():  
        results = system.query(f"query {threading.current_thread().ident}")
        return len(results)
    
    # Run 50 concurrent operations
    threads = []
    for i in range(25):
        threads.append(threading.Thread(target=concurrent_ingest))
        threads.append(threading.Thread(target=concurrent_query))
    
    for t in threads:
        t.start()
    
    for t in threads:
        t.join(timeout=30)  # Should complete within 30s
        assert not t.is_alive()  # No hanging threads
```
