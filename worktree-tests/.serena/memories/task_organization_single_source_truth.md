# Task Organization: Single Source of Truth

## üéØ The Problem We Solved
Previously, tasks were scattered across 5+ locations with massive duplication. Agents had to check multiple files to understand what to do, leading to confusion and wasted effort.

## üìã New Simplified Structure

### 1. IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (Start Here)
**Purpose**: Day-by-day roadmap
**Contains**: 
- What to build each day (Day 1-35)
- High-level tasks and success criteria
- Links to detailed specs

**When to use**: Beginning of each day to see what to implement

### 2. Phase Memory Files (Detailed Specs)
**Purpose**: Detailed implementation instructions
**Files**:
- `phase1_implementation_tasks` - Week 1 Foundation
- `phase2_implementation_tasks_detailed` - Week 2 Cognitive
- `phase3_implementation_tasks_consolidated` - Week 3 Advanced
- `phase4_implementation_tasks` - Week 4 Consolidation
- `phase5_implementation_tasks` - Week 5 Production

**When to use**: When implementing specific features

### 3. TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md (Quality Only)
**Purpose**: Quality checks during coding
**Contains**:
- Code formatting commands
- Testing requirements
- Security checks
- Performance verification
- NO implementation tasks (removed)

**When to use**: While coding and before committing

### 4. docs/TASK_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md (Infrastructure)
**Purpose**: PROJECT-XXX infrastructure tasks
**Contains**:
- One-time setup tasks
- CI/CD configuration
- Documentation tasks

**When to use**: For non-implementation work

### 5. docs/progress/ (Progress Tracking)
**Purpose**: Track what's been done
**Replaces**: SETUP_STATUS_SUMMARY.md (archived)

**When to use**: To check current progress

## üöÄ Agent Workflow

```
1. Start session ‚Üí Read AGENT_START_HERE.md
2. Check current day ‚Üí IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
3. Get details ‚Üí Phase memory file
4. While coding ‚Üí TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md
5. Track progress ‚Üí Update docs/progress/
```

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

1. **Removed duplicates**:
   - Consolidated phase3 memories (2 ‚Üí 1)
   - Removed phase tasks from TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST
   - Archived outdated SETUP_STATUS_SUMMARY

2. **Clear purposes**:
   - Each file has ONE clear purpose
   - No overlapping content
   - Single source of truth for each type

3. **Simple navigation**:
   - Start with IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE
   - Drill down to memories for details
   - Use checklist for quality only

## üìù Key Rules

1. **Implementation tasks** ‚Üí ONLY in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE + memories
2. **Quality checks** ‚Üí ONLY in TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST
3. **Progress** ‚Üí ONLY in docs/progress/
4. **No duplication** ‚Üí Each task in ONE place only

## üé™ Example: Finding Day 3 Tasks

```
1. Open IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
2. Find "Day 3: Vector Management & Dimensions"
3. See high-level tasks
4. Open phase1_implementation_tasks memory
5. Find "Day 3" section for detailed code
6. Use TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST while coding
```

This organization ensures agents always know exactly where to look for any information.
