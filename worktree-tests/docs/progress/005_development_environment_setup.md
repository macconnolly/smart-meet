# Progress Update 005: Development Environment Setup Complete

## Date: 2025-06-27

### Summary
Successfully set up the development environment and initialized databases for the Cognitive Meeting Intelligence system.

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Fixed vector_store.py missing numpy import
2. ✅ Fixed init_db.py to match actual schema
3. ✅ Fixed init_qdrant.py syntax errors (shebang and EOF issues)
4. ✅ Installed core Python dependencies (fastapi, qdrant-client, aiosqlite, etc.)
5. ✅ Created SQLite database with 5 tables (meetings, memories, memory_connections, search_history, system_metadata)
6. ✅ Started Qdrant vector database (Docker container running)
7. ✅ Updated AGENT_START_HERE.md with database setup instructions
8. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation:
   - GIT_WORKFLOW.md - Branch strategy and commit conventions
   - TASK_TRACKING_USAGE_GUIDE.md - How to use the task system
   - database_setup_guide memory - Database architecture reference

### Current State
- **Python Version**: 3.12.3 (project specifies 3.11 but 3.12 works)
- **Databases**: 
  - SQLite initialized at `data/memories.db` with proper schema
  - Qdrant running on localhost:6333
- **Dependencies**: Core packages installed, ML packages (torch, transformers) pending due to size
- **Project State**: 6/7 checks passing in check_project_state.py

### Next Steps
1. Begin Day 1 implementation tasks (IMPL-D1-001 through IMPL-D1-005)
2. Create feature branch for Day 1 work
3. Start with core models implementation in src/models/entities.py

### Blockers
- None currently. Ready to begin implementation.

### Notes
- Using Python 3.12 instead of 3.11 (works fine with current dependencies)
- ML packages (torch, transformers, onnxruntime) can be installed when needed
- All 129 implementation tasks are documented and ready in TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md
