# 000 - Initial Project Setup

## Overview
Setting up the Cognitive Meeting Intelligence project structure, documentation, and tracking systems.

## Status
- **Started**: 2024-12-19
- **Current Step**: Creating essential files and documentation
- **Completion**: 85%
- **Expected Completion**: Today

## Objectives
- [x] Clean up outdated documentation
- [x] Create complete project skeleton with TODO placeholders
- [x] Add detailed implementation phases to IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- [x] Create missing src/models/entities.py
- [x] Establish task tracking system
- [ ] Initialize git repository
- [ ] Create remaining missing files

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Documentation Cleanup
**Status**: Completed
**Date Range**: 2024-12-19

#### Tasks Completed
- Deleted 5 outdated documentation files
- Identified conflicts with IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- Preserved essential documentation

### Step 2: Project Skeleton Creation
**Status**: Completed
**Date Range**: 2024-12-19

#### Tasks Completed
- Created all Day 1-7 implementation files
- Added proper TODO comments with Day references
- Included type hints and docstrings
- Created supporting files (requirements.txt, Makefile, etc.)

### Step 3: Task Management System
**Status**: In Progress
**Date Range**: 2024-12-19

#### Tasks Completed
- Created TASK_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md for dual-track management
- Created task_management_best_practices memory
- Established PROJECT/INFRA vs IMPL task separation

#### Current Work
- Need to initialize git repository (PROJECT-001)
- Creating remaining missing files (PROJECT-002)

#### Next Tasks
- Run git init and make initial commit
- Create scripts/check_project_state.py
- Create PR template

## Technical Notes

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Dual-track task system**: 
   - PROJECT/INFRA tasks in TASK_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md
   - IMPL tasks in memories and progress docs
   
2. **Task numbering convention**:
   - PROJECT-XXX: Setup and infrastructure
   - IMPL-DX-XXX: Implementation tasks by day

3. **File structure validates against IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**:
   - Each file has TODO comments referencing its implementation day
   - Missing entities.py file was critical - now created

## Dependencies
- Git must be initialized before any development
- Docker needed for Qdrant
- Python 3.8+ for development

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: No git history means no version control
  - **Mitigation**: PROJECT-001 is highest priority
- **Risk**: Overlapping memories causing confusion
  - **Mitigation**: PROJECT-003 will consolidate

## Resources
- [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](../../IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
- [TASK_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md](../TASK_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md)
- [structured_development_workflow memory](memories)
