## Objectives
- [x] Create comprehensive skeleton structure for all system components
- [x] Add detailed agentic empowerment TO-DO messages in every file
- [x] Establish production-ready development environment
- [x] Design complete testing framework
- [x] Document progress using established template
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Relocate work to correct directory

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Skeleton Architecture Creation

#### Current Work
- **CRITICAL ERROR**: All work completed in wrong directory `C:\Users\EL436GA\claude\cognitive-meeting-intelligence`
- Need to relocate relevant skeleton files to correct project structure

#### Next Tasks
- Assess existing project structure in correct directory
- Integrate skeleton work with existing codebase
- Update skeleton files to match project conventions

### Step 2: Agentic Empowerment Integration
**Status**: Completed
**Date Range**: 2025-01-27

#### Tasks Completed
- Added 300+ detailed TO-DO messages with implementation guidance
- Explained cognitive intelligence concepts and architecture decisions
- Provided performance targets (<2s latency, 10-15 memories/second)
- Included comprehensive error handling and validation patterns
- Created self-documenting code with implementation confidence

#### Current Work
- Documentation exists but in wrong location

#### Next Tasks
- Review existing project code structure
- Adapt agentic empowerment messages to current project state

### Step 3: Development Infrastructure
**Status**: Completed (Wrong Location)
**Date Range**: 2025-01-27

#### Tasks Completed
- Created Docker multi-stage builds for development, testing, and production
- Established comprehensive testing configuration with pytest
- Built CI/CD configuration with quality checks (black, flake8, mypy)
- Created database initialization scripts with sample data
- Designed ML model download and ONNX optimization scripts

#### Current Work
- Infrastructure created but needs integration with existing project

#### Next Tasks
- Compare with existing project infrastructure
- Merge beneficial infrastructure improvements

## Technical Notes

### Architecture Components Created
1. **Memory Models** (400D Vectors):
   - 384D semantic embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
   - 16D cognitive dimensions (temporal, emotional, social, decision, etc.)
   - Memory types: Episodic, Semantic, Bridge, Activated
   - Vector composition and similarity operations

2. **Storage Layer**:
   - SQLite repository pattern with comprehensive schema
   - Qdrant 3-tier vector storage (concepts/contexts/episodes)
   - Relationship management and access tracking

3. **Cognitive Engines**:
   - BFS activation spreading with two-phase algorithm
   - Distance inversion bridge discovery for serendipitous connections
   - Intelligent consolidation from episodic to semantic memories

4. **Processing Pipeline**:
   - ONNX-based embedding generation
   - 16-dimensional cognitive feature extraction
   - Memory extraction from meeting transcripts
   - Content type classification and quality assessment

5. **API & Interface**:
   - FastAPI application with memory CRUD and cognitive endpoints
   - Comprehensive CLI for ingestion, querying, and administration
   - Real-time processing capabilities

### Design Patterns Implemented
- Repository Pattern for data access
- Engine Pattern for cognitive processing
- Factory Pattern for memory creation
- Strategy Pattern for pluggable extractors

## Dependencies
- **CRITICAL**: Correct project directory assessment required
- Existing project code structure analysis needed
- Integration with established development workflow
- Alignment with existing .serena memory system

## Risks & Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Directory Error**: All work completed in wrong location
  - **Mitigation**: Assess existing project, integrate beneficial components

### Medium Risk  
- **Code Duplication**: Skeleton may conflict with existing code
  - **Mitigation**: Careful review and selective integration

- **Architecture Mismatch**: Skeleton architecture may not align with project
  - **Mitigation**: Adapt skeleton to existing patterns and conventions

## Resources
- **Created Skeleton Location**: `C:\Users\EL436GA\claude\cognitive-meeting-intelligence`
- **Correct Project Location**: `C:\Users\EL436GA\dev\meet`
- **Existing Progress**: `docs/progress/000_initial_setup.md`, `001_task_consolidation.md`, `002_documentation_alignment.md`
- **Template**: `docs/templates/progress_documentation_template.md`

## Change Log
- **2025-01-27 - Initial Creation**: Created comprehensive skeleton structure with agentic empowerment
- **2025-01-27 - Critical Error Identified**: Discovered work completed in wrong directory
- **2025-01-27 - Progress Documentation**: Created this progress document in correct location

## **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### Critical Error Correction
1. **Assess Existing Project**: Review current codebase in `C:\Users\EL436GA\dev\meet`
2. **Selective Integration**: Identify beneficial skeleton components for integration
3. **Adapt Architecture**: Align skeleton work with existing project patterns
4. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all documentation reflects correct project state

### Value Preservation
Despite the directory error, the skeleton work provides:
- **300+ Implementation Guidance Messages**: Detailed TO-DOs for every component
- **Complete Architecture Vision**: 400D vector intelligence with cognitive processing
- **Production Infrastructure**: Docker, testing, and deployment configurations
- **Performance Design**: <2s latency and 10-15 memories/second targets

### Next Session Priority
**Focus**: Assess existing project structure and integrate beneficial skeleton components into the correct codebase while preserving the agentic empowerment approach.
