# Progress Documentation Format

## File Naming Convention
Progress files are named using the format: `XXX_Description.md`
- `XXX`: 3-digit zero-padded sequential number (000, 001, 002, etc.)
- `Description`: Brief descriptive name of the milestone/step
- Examples: `000_bootstrapping.md`, `001_core_architecture.md`, `002_testing_framework.md`

## Progress Document Structure

Each progress document must follow this standardized format:

```markdown
# [Milestone Number] - [Milestone Title]

## Overview
Brief description of what this milestone encompasses and its objectives.

## Status
- **Started**: [Date]
- **Current Step**: [Step name]
- **Completion**: [Percentage or status]
- **Expected Completion**: [Date estimate]

## Objectives
- [ ] Objective 1
- [ ] Objective 2
- [ ] Objective 3

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: [Step Name]
**Status**: [Not Started/In Progress/Completed]
**Date Range**: [Start Date - End Date]

#### Tasks Completed
- Task description with timestamp
- Another completed task

#### Current Work
- Description of ongoing work
- Blockers or challenges

#### Next Tasks
- Planned next actions
- Dependencies

### Step 2: [Step Name]
**Status**: [Not Started/In Progress/Completed]
**Date Range**: [Start Date - End Date]

[Repeat structure as needed for additional steps]

## Technical Notes
Key technical decisions, architecture choices, or implementation details.

## Dependencies
- External dependencies
- Internal module dependencies
- Blocking/blocked by other milestones

## Risks & Mitigation
- Identified risks
- Mitigation strategies

## Resources
- Links to relevant documentation
- Code references
- External resources

## Change Log
- **[Date]**: Brief description of major changes or updates
- **[Date]**: Another significant update
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Sequential Numbering**: Always use the next available sequential number
2. **Regular Updates**: Update progress documents frequently as work progresses
3. **Status Tracking**: Keep the status section current with accurate completion percentages
4. **Step Management**: Break complex milestones into logical steps
5. **Documentation**: Include relevant technical notes and decisions
6. **Dependencies**: Clearly identify and track dependencies between milestones

## Example Usage

### Creating a New Progress Document
1. Check the `docs/progress/` directory for the highest numbered file
2. Create a new file with the next sequential number
3. Use descriptive naming: `003_vector_storage_implementation.md`
4. Copy the template structure from above
5. Fill in all sections with relevant information

### Updating Progress
1. Update the **Status** section with current completion percentage
2. Move tasks from "Next Tasks" to "Tasks Completed" as they finish
3. Add new items to "Current Work" as you begin them
4. Update the Change Log with significant updates
5. Keep technical notes current with decisions made

### Linking Documents
- Reference other progress documents: `See [001_core_architecture.md](001_core_architecture.md)`
- Link to code: `Implementation in [src/models/entities.py](../../src/models/entities.py)`
- Reference external docs: `Based on [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](../../IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)`
