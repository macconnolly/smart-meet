# Git Workflow Adherence Analysis

## üîç Key Issues Identified

### 1. **Agents Not Reading Git Workflow Documentation**
- The `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` exists but agents aren't being directed to it
- CLAUDE.md doesn't reference the git workflow requirements
- No explicit reminders about commit message conventions

### 2. **Current Branch Situation**
- Currently on: `feature/day-2-embeddings-infrastructure` 
- This follows the correct pattern: `feature/day-{N}-{description}`
- However, individual task branches (`impl/D2-XXX-*`) are not being created

### 3. **Commit Message Issues**
- Recent commits don't follow the convention:
  ```
  <type>: <description> [<task-id>]
  ```
- Missing task ID references like `[IMPL-D2-001]`
- No `Refs: #D2-001` in commit bodies

### 4. **Missing Git Workflow Enforcement**
- No pre-commit hooks configured
- Agents aren't checking status before commits
- No automatic formatting/linting before commits

## üìã Root Causes

### 1. **CLAUDE.md Doesn't Include Git Rules**
The main instruction file for agents (`CLAUDE.md`) focuses on:
- Task management (TodoWrite/TodoRead)
- Performance standards
- Code quality

But MISSING:
- Git workflow requirements
- Commit message standards
- Branch strategy

### 2. **No Git-Specific Memory**
While we have memories for:
- `suggested_commands` - Includes git commands but not workflow
- `agent_implementation_guidelines` - Focuses on code patterns

Missing:
- `git_workflow_rules` memory
- Enforcement mechanisms

### 3. **Agents Default to Generic Patterns**
Without explicit git rules in their context, agents use:
- Generic commit messages
- Direct commits to feature branches
- No task ID tracking

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

### 1. **Update CLAUDE.md**
Add a dedicated section:
```markdown
## üîÄ Git Workflow Requirements

### CRITICAL: All commits MUST follow these rules:

1. **Create task branches for each implementation**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b impl/D2-001-onnx-encoder
   ```

2. **Commit messages MUST include task ID**:
   ```
   feat: Implement ONNX encoder with caching [IMPL-D2-001]
   
   - Add ONNXEncoder class with warmup
   - Implement LRU caching for embeddings
   - Performance: <100ms encoding achieved
   
   Refs: #D2-001
   ```

3. **Always check before committing**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --staged
   git log --oneline -3
   ```

4. **Reference TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md** for task IDs
```

### 2. **Create Git Workflow Memory**
Create a new memory file that agents will load:
```bash
mcp__serena__write_memory git_workflow_enforcement
```

### 3. **Add Pre-commit Hooks**
Configure `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.11.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
        language_version: python3.12
        args: [--line-length=100]
  
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 6.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
        args: [--max-line-length=100]
  
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: check-task-id
        name: Check Task ID in commit message
        entry: scripts/check_commit_msg.py
        language: python
        stages: [commit-msg]
```

### 4. **Enhance Agent Context**
Update the system prompt to include:
- Git workflow is MANDATORY
- Task IDs must be tracked
- Commits must reference implementation tasks

## üéØ Immediate Actions

1. **Add Git Rules to CLAUDE.md** ‚úÖ
2. **Create git enforcement memory** 
3. **Setup pre-commit hooks**
4. **Update agent instructions to check GIT_WORKFLOW.md**

## üìä Expected Outcomes

With these changes:
- ‚úÖ Agents will create proper task branches
- ‚úÖ Commit messages will include task IDs
- ‚úÖ Code quality checks run automatically
- ‚úÖ Better traceability between tasks and code

## üö® Current Status

The project has good git documentation but poor enforcement. Agents need explicit instructions in their primary context (CLAUDE.md) to follow these workflows.
