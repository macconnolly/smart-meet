# Project Setup Status - Enhanced Schema Implementation

## What We've Updated

### 1. Enhanced Database Schema
- Updated `src/storage/sqlite/schema.sql` with full consulting schema
- Added 7 main tables: projects, meetings, memories, stakeholders, deliverables, memory_connections, meeting_series
- Added 2 utility tables: query_statistics, bridge_cache
- Created 4 useful views for consulting insights
- Comprehensive indexes for performance

### 2. Enhanced Data Models
- Updated `src/models/entities.py` with all consulting models
- Added comprehensive enums for type safety
- Created models: Project, Meeting, Stakeholder, Deliverable, Memory (enhanced), MemoryConnection
- Added validation and helper methods
- JSON field parsing for structured data

### 3. Documentation Structure
- Created `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` as the master guide
- Updated `README.md` to reference implementation guide
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` to point to implementation guide
- Created `docs/architecture/system-overview.md`

### 4. Setup Infrastructure
- Created `scripts/setup_all.py` for complete project setup
- Created `scripts/init_db.py` for database initialization
- Created `Makefile` with common commands
- Created `docker-compose.yml` for services
- Created configuration files (.env.example, pytest.ini, setup.cfg)

### 5. Project Structure
All directories created with __init__.py files:
- src/core, models, extraction, embedding, cognitive, storage, pipeline, api
- tests/unit, integration, performance, fixtures
- scripts, config, models, data, docs

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Use Enhanced Schema from Start**: Avoid migrations, build with full consulting context
2. **Comprehensive Models**: All entities defined with proper validation
3. **Clear Documentation**: Single source of truth in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
4. **Automated Setup**: One script to initialize everything

## Next Steps

1. Run `python scripts/setup_all.py` to complete setup
2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies
3. Start implementing Day 1 tasks from IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
4. Database initialization with `python scripts/init_db.py`

## Important Notes

- The schema now includes all consulting features (projects, stakeholders, deliverables)
- Memory model enhanced with priority, status, owner fields
- All relationships properly defined with foreign keys
- Views created for common consulting queries
- Ready for multi-project, multi-client architecture
