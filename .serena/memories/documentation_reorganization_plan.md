# Documentation Reorganization Plan

## Current Issues
1. **Multiple task tracking systems** causing confusion
2. **No clear entry point** for new agents
3. **TodoWrite/TodoRead** not prominently featured
4. **Duplicate phase memories** need consolidation

## New Documentation Flow

### Entry Points
1. **docs/AGENT_START_HERE.md** (NEW) - 2-minute orientation
2. **README.md** - Points to AGENT_START_HERE
3. **SETUP_STATUS_SUMMARY.md** - Current state check

### Task Hierarchy (Clear Separation)
```
Level 1: Project Tasks (PROJECT-XXX)
├── docs/TASK_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md
├── One-time setup tasks
└── Infrastructure work

Level 2: Implementation Tasks (IMPL-XXX)  
├── IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (day-by-day)
├── Memory files (detailed specs)
└── In-code TODOs

Level 3: Session Tasks (TodoWrite)
├── TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md (instructions)
├── Break down daily work
└── Track progress in real-time
```

### Files to Consolidate
1. Merge phase3_implementation_tasks + phase3_implementation_tasks_detailed
2. Archive old strategy memories that have been superseded
3. Create single "implementation_phases_overview" memory

### Documentation Purpose Matrix
| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| AGENT_START_HERE.md | Quick orientation | First time on project |
| IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md | What to build today | Start of each day |
| TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md | Quality checks | During coding |
| Memory files | Detailed specs | When implementing specific phase |
| TASK_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md | Task numbering | Creating new tasks |

## Action Items
1. ✅ Created AGENT_START_HERE.md with clear workflow
2. ✅ Updated README with prominent link
3. ✅ Added file relationships to TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST
4. ⏳ Need to consolidate duplicate memories
5. ⏳ Need to create DEVELOPER_SETUP.md
