# Technical Development Strategy - Sequential Analysis

## Current Approach Issues

### 1. **Linear Dependencies**
- Building storage before knowing data structures
- Implementing embeddings before having extraction logic
- Creating APIs before core algorithms work

### 2. **Late Risk Discovery**
- Cognitive algorithms (the core innovation) pushed to Phase 2
- Performance validation only at the end
- No early proof of concept for activation spreading

### 3. **Integration Challenges**
- Components built in isolation
- Integration only tested at phase boundaries
- No continuous validation of assumptions

## Better Technical Approach: Iterative Vertical Slices

### Sprint 0: Proof of Concept (1 week)
**Goal**: Validate core cognitive algorithms work
```
1. Prototype activation spreading with mock data
2. Test bridge discovery algorithm
3. Verify performance is achievable
4. Create simple demo
```

### Sprint 1: Minimal Pipeline (2 weeks)
**Goal**: End-to-end working system with basic features
```
1. Simple memory extraction (just decisions)
2. Basic embeddings (can be random initially)
3. In-memory storage (no database yet)
4. Basic activation spreading
5. Simple API endpoint
```

### Sprint 2: Real Components (2 weeks)
**Goal**: Replace mocks with real implementations
```
1. ONNX model integration
2. SQLite for metadata
3. Qdrant for vectors
4. Proper memory extraction
5. API with error handling
```

### Sprint 3: Cognitive Features (2 weeks)
**Goal**: Full cognitive intelligence
```
1. Two-phase activation spreading
2. Bridge discovery
3. Basic consolidation
4. Performance optimization
```

### Sprint 4: Production Ready (2 weeks)
**Goal**: Hardening and deployment
```
1. Security implementation
2. Monitoring and logging
3. Documentation
4. Deployment automation
```

## Technical Principles

### 1. **Test-Driven Development**
```python
# Write test first
def test_activation_spreading():
    # Define expected behavior
    memory_graph = create_test_graph()
    result = spread_activation(query, memory_graph)
    assert len(result.core) > 0
    assert result.time_ms < 500

# Then implement
def spread_activation(query, graph):
    # Implementation to pass test
```

### 2. **Continuous Integration**
- Every commit runs tests
- Performance benchmarks on every merge
- Automated quality checks

### 3. **Iterative Enhancement**
```
Version 0.1: Works with hardcoded data
Version 0.2: Works with real transcripts
Version 0.3: Handles edge cases
Version 1.0: Production ready
```

### 4. **Risk-First Development**
Order of implementation by technical risk:
1. Activation spreading algorithm (highest risk)
2. Bridge discovery (novel algorithm)
3. Vector composition (performance critical)
4. Memory consolidation (complex state management)
5. API layer (well-understood)
