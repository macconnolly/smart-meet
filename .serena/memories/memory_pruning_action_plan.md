# Memory Pruning & Cleanup Actions

## ðŸ§¹ Immediate Cleanup Required

### 1. Duplicate Phase Memories (PROJECT-003)
**Action**: Merge and archive
- `phase3_implementation_tasks` + `phase3_implementation_tasks_detailed` â†’ Merge into single `phase3_detailed_implementation`
- Archive originals with prefix `ARCHIVED_`

### 2. Redundant Strategy Documents
**Action**: Archive these memories (content now in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
- `consolidated_implementation_strategy` â†’ ARCHIVE
- `minimal_viable_features` â†’ ARCHIVE
- `technical_development_strategy` â†’ ARCHIVE (mostly redundant)

### 3. Overlapping Setup Memories
**Action**: Consolidate
- `critical_setup_actions_remaining` â†’ Merge into PROJECT tasks in TASK_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md
- `memory_consolidation_plan` â†’ This is actually useful, keep
- `development_preparation_cleanup_plan` â†’ Keep, has unique workflow content

### 4. Outdated Conversation States
**Action**: Delete
- `conversation_state_refine_setup` â†’ DELETE (old conversation context)

## ðŸ“‚ Recommended Memory Structure

```
Active Memories:
â”œâ”€â”€ Core References
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project_overview
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ enhanced_database_schema
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tech_stack
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Workflows & Standards
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ structured_development_workflow
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code_style_conventions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task_management_best_practices
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_driven_development
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Implementation Guides (Per Phase)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ phase1_implementation_tasks
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ phase2_implementation_tasks_detailed
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ phase3_detailed_implementation (merged)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ phase4_implementation_tasks
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ phase5_implementation_tasks
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Architecture & Technical
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project_architecture_patterns
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ storage_architecture_decision
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pipeline_integration_guide
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api_endpoints_documentation
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ Setup & Admin
    â”œâ”€â”€ suggested_commands
    â”œâ”€â”€ memory_consolidation_plan
    â””â”€â”€ agent_implementation_guidelines

Archived Memories:
â”œâ”€â”€ ARCHIVED_consolidated_implementation_strategy
â”œâ”€â”€ ARCHIVED_minimal_viable_features
â”œâ”€â”€ ARCHIVED_technical_development_strategy
â”œâ”€â”€ ARCHIVED_phase3_implementation_tasks
â””â”€â”€ ARCHIVED_phase3_implementation_tasks_detailed
```

## ðŸ”§ Cleanup Commands

```python
# 1. Archive redundant memories
mcp__serena__write_memory("ARCHIVED_consolidated_implementation_strategy", content)
mcp__serena__delete_memory("consolidated_implementation_strategy")

# 2. Merge phase3 memories
phase3_content = merge_phase3_memories()
mcp__serena__write_memory("phase3_detailed_implementation", phase3_content)
mcp__serena__delete_memory("phase3_implementation_tasks")
mcp__serena__delete_memory("phase3_implementation_tasks_detailed")

# 3. Delete outdated
mcp__serena__delete_memory("conversation_state_refine_setup")
mcp__serena__delete_memory("critical_setup_actions_remaining")
```

## âœ… After Cleanup Benefits

1. **Clear Hierarchy**: Each memory has a specific purpose
2. **No Duplication**: Single source of truth per topic
3. **Easy Navigation**: Logical grouping by function
4. **Maintains History**: Archives preserve important content
5. **Reduced Confusion**: Developers know exactly where to look

## ðŸš¨ Do This Before Any More Development!

The memory consolidation should happen NOW before more memories are created. This will prevent further confusion and make the project much easier to navigate.
