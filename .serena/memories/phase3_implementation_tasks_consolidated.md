# Phase 3: Bridge Discovery & Advanced Dimensions (Week 3)

> **Purpose**: Complete the 400D vector system with advanced dimensions and add serendipitous discovery through distance inversion.
> **Prerequisites**: Phase 1 & 2 complete, Docker running, test data available

## Overview
Phase 3 implements the advanced cognitive features:
- Bridge discovery with distance inversion algorithm
- Advanced dimension extractors (Social, Causal, Strategic)
- Performance optimization with caching
- Integration with activation spreading

## Day 1: Bridge Discovery Engine

### Task 3.1: Create Bridge Discovery Models
**File**: `src/cognitive/bridges/engine.py`
**Time**: 2-3 hours

Create the core bridge discovery engine with:
```python
@dataclass
class BridgeMemory:
    memory_id: str
    memory_content: str
    bridge_score: float  # Combined score
    novelty_score: float  # Distance from query (0-1)
    connection_potential: float  # Connection to activated set
    connection_path: List[str]
    explanation: str
```

**Algorithm**:
1. Find memories distant from query (high novelty)
2. But connected to activated memories (relevance)
3. Score = novelty_weight * novelty + connection_weight * connection
4. Return top 5 bridges

**Success**: Bridge discovery < 1s for 5 bridges

## Day 2: Advanced Dimension Extractors

### Task 3.2.1: Social Dimension Extractor
**File**: `src/extraction/dimensions/social.py`
**Output**: 3D vector [authority, audience_relevance, interaction_score]

Features to detect:
- Authority markers (CEO, decide, approve vs suggest, think)
- Audience indicators (@mentions, departments, team/everyone)
- Interaction patterns (directive, collaborative, questioning)

### Task 3.2.2: Causal Dimension Extractor
**File**: `src/extraction/dimensions/causal.py`
**Output**: 3D vector [cause_effect_strength, logical_coherence, impact_scope]

Features to detect:
- Causal patterns (because, therefore, leads to, results in)
- Logical connectors (thus, consequently, as a result)
- Impact indicators (critical, significant vs minor, negligible)

### Task 3.2.3: Strategic Dimension Extractor
**File**: `src/extraction/dimensions/strategic.py`
**Output**: 3D vector [strategic_alignment, time_horizon, risk_opportunity_balance]

Features to detect:
- Strategy types (growth, efficiency, innovation, transformation)
- Time indicators (immediate, Q1/Q2, yearly, 5-year, vision)
- Risk vs opportunity language

**Success**: All extractors < 50ms, normalized [0,1] values

## Day 3: Integration & Caching

### Task 3.3.1: Integrate with Activation Engine
**File**: `src/api/cognitive_routes.py`

Enhanced endpoint flow:
1. Generate 400D query vector (with all dimensions)
2. Run activation spreading
3. Use activated set for bridge discovery
4. Return combined results

### Task 3.3.2: Implement Bridge Cache
**File**: `src/cognitive/bridges/cache.py`

Features:
- SQLite cache with TTL
- Cache key from query vector + activated memories
- Background cleanup task
- Hit rate tracking

**Success**: Cache hit rate > 60%

## Day 4: Testing & Optimization

### Task 3.4.1: Comprehensive Tests
- Unit tests for each dimension extractor
- Bridge discovery algorithm tests
- Integration tests with activation
- Performance benchmarks

### Task 3.4.2: Performance Monitoring
**File**: `src/monitoring/performance.py`

Track:
- Bridge discovery latency (target < 1s)
- Dimension extraction times (target < 50ms each)
- Full pipeline performance (target < 2s)
- Cache effectiveness

## Success Criteria

### Functionality

## Key Commands
```bash
# Test dimension extractors
python -c "from src.extraction.dimensions import *; print(social.extract('CEO decided'))"

# Test bridge discovery
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/cognitive/query/enhanced \
  -d '{"query": "strategic decisions", "include_bridges": true}'

# Check performance
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/monitoring/performance

# Run all Phase 3 tests
pytest tests/test_bridge_*.py tests/test_*_dimension.py -v
```
