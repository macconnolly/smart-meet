# Conversation State - Refine Setup

## Current Status
- User requested to start over or refine the project setup
- Onboarding has already been performed previously
- All standard project memories are available (code_style_conventions, project_architecture_patterns, project_overview, suggested_commands, task_completion_checklist, tech_stack)

## Next Steps
- User may want to:
  1. Re-run onboarding to update project information
  2. Modify existing memories with new information
  3. Add new memories for specific aspects of the project
  4. Start fresh with a clean slate

## Context
