# ✅ Everything is Ready!

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### 1. Setup Python environments (one time)
```bash
# Quick setup with minimal packages
./setup_minimal_venvs.sh

# OR full setup (if you need all packages)
./setup_worktree_venvs.sh
```

### 2. Start Claude in Test Worktree (FIRST!)
```bash
cd worktree-tests
source venv/bin/activate
claude code .
```

### 3. Your First Tasks
When Claude starts in the test worktree:
1. Create `tests/unit/test_models.py` - Test the data models
2. Make tests fail properly (RED phase)
3. Commit with message: `test: Add unit tests for Memory model [TEST-D1-001]`

### 4. Then Move to Implementation
```bash
cd ../worktree-day1
source venv/bin/activate
claude code .
```

## 📋 Current Status
- ✅ 5 worktrees created (main + tests + day1/2/3)
- ✅ Each has its own minimal requirements file
- ✅ Coordination script ready (`./worktree-sync.sh`)
- ✅ All worktrees synced with latest changes
- ❌ No tests written yet (0/129 tasks)
- 🎯 Ready for TDD development!

## 🔧 Helpful Commands
```bash
# Check worktree status
./worktree-sync.sh status

# See what tests to write
./worktree-sync.sh check

# Share tests to implementation
./worktree-sync.sh share worktree-tests worktree-day1

# Run tests
./worktree-sync.sh test worktree-day1
```

## 📚 Key Documents
- `AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` - Mandatory development process
- `DAY_BASED_WORKTREE_GUIDE.md` - Detailed worktree guide
- `TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md` - Track progress (0/129 done)
- `VENV_REFERENCE.md` - Python environment help

## 🎯 Remember the Process
1. **ALWAYS** write tests first (in worktree-tests)
2. **NEVER** implement without failing tests
3. **ALWAYS** activate venv before starting
4. **ALWAYS** use task IDs in commits
5. **UPDATE** checklist after completing tasks

Good luck with the TDD implementation! 🚀
