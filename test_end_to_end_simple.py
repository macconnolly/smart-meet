    Sarah: We have a critical issue with the vendor performance. Their API response times have degraded by 40% this week.
    
    John: That's concerning. We need to escalate this immediately to their technical team.
    
    Sarah: I agree. Also, this is impacting our customer satisfaction scores. We're seeing a spike in complaints.
    
    John: Let's implement a caching layer as a temporary workaround while we push the vendor to fix their issues.
    
    Sarah: Good idea. I'll make that our top priority. Can you set up a meeting with their CTO for tomorrow?
    
    John: Will do. We should also update our risk register - this vendor dependency is becoming a major concern.
    
    Sarah: Absolutely. And let's start evaluating alternative vendors as a contingency plan.
